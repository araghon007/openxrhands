Open XR hands and hand meshes for Oculus in Unity

This is an implementation of the open XR extensions:
- XR_EXT_hand_tracking (should work on multiple devices)
- XR_FB_hand_tracking_mesh (Oculus specific) 

These allow you 
1) To get hand joint positions from some kind of hand tracker, e.g. Oculus Quest, Hololens. 
2) To get a mesh representing the user's hand.

Check out HandGetter for an example of getting the hand positions into a mesh.
